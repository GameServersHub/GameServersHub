## üõ†Ô∏è The Power of ServerAPI:
We have built and created the official community-driven "ServerAPI" framework which has been developed in-house by our team of experts. This open-source ServerAPI framework serves as the backbone for hosting "Ark Plugins" for two of the most popular video games in the market: "Ark: Survival Evolved" and "Ark: Survival Ascended." 

Our ServerAPI framework is a powerful tool designed to streamline the entire server management process. It offers a seamless experience for both the server owners and players, making it easier for them to manage and host their Ark plugins. The framework is packed with a variety of advanced features that make it a one-stop solution for all your server management needs. 

So, whether you are a server owner or a player, our ServerAPI framework is sure to make your Ark gaming experience much more enjoyable and hassle-free. We are excited to offer this powerful framework to our users and look forward to their feedback.
